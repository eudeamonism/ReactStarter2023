You shouldn't put an event listener inside a button when that button is inside a form.

Forms automatically listen for an event when a button is inside it.

-add listener on form

<form onSubmit={}>

-put e.preventDefault(); so form doesn't autmatically submit.

TWO WAY BINDING

We're going to add the value attribute inside the input element.

We're adding default value from destructured array from setState.

<input ... value={enteredTitle}>

SUMMARY: When we change the state we change the input. We are allowed to reset the forms upon each use.

OK --> When we submit the form, we can place the setState functions below, and therefore reset the form fields to blank.

PS --> Don't forget to add vallue atribute to each input with their respective useState value variable.
